Introduction:

This is a website application that users (employers) can post their job postings on it, and they could search for postings by keywords (job title or position). A user can find all related information of the postings, and they could get details on right hand side by clicking the search result list. Moreover, in the bottom of the detail side, it will show the user who posted this posting, and he could click the user link by viewing that user’s more posting list and posting details, but if the user who posted this posting has been unregistered, there will a notice that said “the user who posted this posting has been unregistered”. Also, a user could search username in keyword and they will get a list of users related to the keyword. A user could follow the users who he has not followed yet by clicking the empty star, at the same time, he could unfollow the user who he has followed already by clicking the full star. He could find his followings and followers by clicking the nav-bar.
